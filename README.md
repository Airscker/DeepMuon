## Introduction

DeepMuon is a easy-using deep learning platform initially built for dark matter searching experiments. Up to now it has been a interdisciplinary deep learning platform. We are eager to provide advanced model training framework and excellent project management assistance.

Here we list out some available features of DeepMuon:

- **Single GPU** training， **Distributed Data Parallel** training and **Fully Sharded Distributed Parallel** training.
- Neural Network Hyperparameter Searching (NNHS)
- Gradient accumulation
- Gradient clipping
- Mixed precision training
- Double precision training
- Customize models
- Customize datasets
- Customize loss functions
- Tidy logging system
- Model interpretation
- Simple and direct tutorials

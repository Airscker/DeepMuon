# Start your first experiment

We believe you have learned all basic usage methods of DeepMuon, now it's time to start your trip in the world of interdisciplinary deep-learning!

The start command is very simple, let's introduce MLP model & MINIST dataset as an example:

```bash
Dmuon_train -g 0 1 -p 20224 -c config.py -tr dist_train
```

# Start your first experiment

We believe you have learned all the basic usage methods of DeepMuon, now it's time to start your trip in the world of interdisciplinary deep-learning!

The start command is very simple, let's introduce the MLP model & MINIST dataset as an example:

```bash
Dmuon_train -g 0 1 -p 20224 -c config.py
```

For more details of experiment training commands, please refer to [Data Distributed Parallel & Fully Sharded Distributed Parallel - SGT/DDP/FSDP in DeepMuon.](https://airscker.github.io/DeepMuon/tutorials/index.html#/train_test/parallel?id=sgtddpfsdp-in-deepmuon)
